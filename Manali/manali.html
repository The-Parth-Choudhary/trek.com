            for zorbing and paragliding. You can also hop onto a cable car and enjoy mesmerizing views of the 
            Himalayas. If you are looking for snow-based activities and sports, winters are the best time to 
            visit while the months of summer are ideal for other adventure sports. It is located in

                <br>
                <p>Although Solang Valley looks magnificent and awe-inspiring throughout the year, the best time to 
                enjoy the pristine beauty and unparalleled vistas of this place is between April and December. 
                This is because the weather during this time is pleasant enough to partake in the various 
                adventurous activities during this time. Over the year, Solang Valley has gained a reputation among 
                tourists as the ski paradise of North India, and you will find many ski agencies here offering courses 
                for learning skiing. The valley is also popular for the delicious local tea that is sold here. Mild 
                snowfall can be seen in the valley since the beginning of October. As the winter months progress, 
                the snow levels increase, from November to January.</p>

            <h2 id="text3">GREAT HIMALYAN NATIONAL PARK</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec3" id="sec3">
                <p>Touted as one of the best places to visit in Manali and its surrounding regions, the Great 
                Himalayan National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The park is home to many rare species, 
                including over 1000 plants, 209 bird species, and 31 mammal species. The elusive snow leopard 
                is the apex predator here, and there are populations of the Himalayan tahr and brown bears. 
                Photographers will relish capturing the wildflowers and glacial valleys that dot the entire 
                terrain. You can also engage in some fun nature activities like hiking and camping in designated 
                areas of the National Park. Permits to enter the park need to be obtained in advance and the 
                park offers many simple yet decent accommodation options within it.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>The GHNP also supports a great diversity of plant life, thanks to its wide altitude range 
                    and relatively undisturbed habitats. From the lofty pines and spruces and the great, spreading 
                    horse chestnuts of the lower valleys, to the dense cushions and prostrate branches of the 
                    alpine herbs and junipers, the park presents an endless variety of vegetation. Although some 
                    areas have been modified by grazing, this is one of the few areas of the Western Himalayas 
                    where the forests and alpine meadows can be seen in something approaching their original state. 
                    The subalpine zone is richest in species, followed by the alpine and upper temperate zones.
                    The flora of GHNP are so much joyfull as the touristers are so attracted with it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Approximately, GREAT HIMALYAN NATIONAL PARK is at a distance of 49 Km from Manali. The 
                        timmings are 10:00 AM to 5:30 PM; everyday. The entry fees is ₹50 for indians and ₹200 for

            <h2 id="text4">ATAL TUNNEL</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec4" id="sec4">
                    <p>Atal Tunnel (also known as Rohtang Tunnel)[1] is a highway tunnel built under the Rohtang 
                    Pass in the eastern Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas on the Leh-Manali Highway in Himachal 
                    Pradesh, India. At a length of 9.02 km, it is the longest highway single-tube tunnel above 
                    10,000 feet (3,048 m) in the world when completed and is named after former Prime Minister 
                    of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. With the existing Atal Tunnel and after the completion of 
                    under-construction Shingo La Tunnel, which is targeted to be completed by 2024, both the 
                    Leh-Manali Highway and the Nimmu–Padum–Darcha road routes will become all-weather roads.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The tunnel reduces the travel time and overall distance between Manali and Keylong 
                        on the way to Leh. The route, which previously went through Gramphu, was 116 km (72.1 mi) 
                        long and took 5 to 6 hours in good conditions. A traveller now reaches the South Portal of 
                        the tunnel from Manali, a distance of 24.4 km (15.2 mi) in about 45 minutes, goes through 
                        the 9.02 km (5.6 mi) long tunnel in about 15 minutes, and reaches Keylong which is 37 km 
                        (23.0 mi) away in about 60 minutes. The new route via the tunnel brings down the total 
                        distance travelled to 71 km (44.1 mi) which can be covered in about 2 hours, a reduction 
                        of around 3 to 4 hours when compared to the earlier route. Moreover, the tunnel bypasses 
                        most of the sites that were prone to road blockades, avalanches, and traffic snarls.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The tunnel is at an elevation of 3,100 metres (10,171 ft) whereas the Rohtang Pass is at 
                            an elevation of 3,978 metres (13,051 ft). It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
                            on 3 October 2020. The cost of the entire project is ₹3,200 crore.</p>

                <h2 id="text5">ROHTANG PASS</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="sec5" id="sec5">
            <p>ROHTANG PASS s a high mountain pass (elevation 3,980 m (13,058 ft)) on the eastern end of 
            the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas around 51 km (32 mi) from Manali in the Indian state of
            Himachal Pradesh. It connects the Kullu Valley with the Lahaul and Spiti Valleys of Himachal 
            Pradesh, India. The pass is open from May to November. It is not particularly high or difficult
            to cross on foot by Himalayan standards, but it has a well-deserved reputation for being dangerous 
            because of unpredictable snowstorms and blizzards. Sometimes travelling to Rohtang Pass is difficult. 
            Therefore, the government is stressing on setting up a ropeway between Kothi village which is in Manali 
            and Rohtang Pass. The NGT (National Green Tribunal) has asked the state government of Himachal Pradesh 
            to complete all the formalities to start a ropeway. With the coming of a ropeway, we can reduce carbon 
            emission from vehicles. Heavy snowfall blocks the road in winter and a ropeway will be very useful.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The best time to visit Rohtang la Pass is from the second week of September to the second week of 
                October. During this time, the pass opens just after monsoons and before it closes for winters. It is 
                recommended to plan your trip during this time, because the summer months, that is May to June, see 
                a lot of tourists in this region. As a result, it gets quite difficult to get a permit to cross the 
                pass. Additionally, there are long traffic jams in Manali, Rohtang, and Gulaba. There is a heavy 
                snowfall in the region around the Rohtang La Pass in winter months, that is, from November to March.</p>
                <br>
                <p>ATTRACTIONS IN AND NEAR ROHTANG PASS are Nehru Kund, Vashisht Hot Water Springs, Hadimba Temple
                & Marhi.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are many myths and tales associated with how the pass came to be named as such. Some people
                say that the pass is named after the majestic mountains of the Himalayan ranges that serve as a link 
                between Kullu and Lahaul valleys. On the other hand, there are still others who suggest that since the 
                pass is the only gateway between the valleys, it must have been carved by the Gods themselves. The 
                locals in Kullu believe that Lord Shiva created the pass, while those in Lahaul think that Gyapo 
                Gyasar, the Western Tibetan king made the pass. But the most common story of how the pass came to 
                be can be guessed from its name. In Ladakhi, the name means ‘pile of corpses.’ The pass got this 
                name because of the large numbers of people who died while trying to cross it</p>
                <br>
                <p>ROHTANG PASS is Known for its scenic beauty, Rohtang Pass holds strategic importance for India. 
                The Pass offers beautiful sights of glaciers, peaks, Lahaul Valley and the Chandra River. The twin 
                peaks of Geypan are also visible from Rohtang. The pass is on the watershed between the water basins of the 
                Chenab River and the Beas River.</p>
