        <h2>KASHMIR</h2>
        <p>Popularly known as the "Paradise on Earth", Jammu and Kashmir is world famous for its 
        scenic splendour, snow-capped mountains, plentiful wildlife, exquisite monuments, hospitable 
        people and local handicrafts. KASHMIR is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian 
        subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term "Kashmir" denoted only the Kashmir Valley 
        between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. Today, the term encompasses a larger 
        area that includes the Indian-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, 
        the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the 
        Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The word Kashmir was derived from the ancient Sanskrit language and was referred to 
            as káśmīra. The Nilamata Purana describes the valley's origin from the waters, a lake 
            called Sati-saras. A popular local etymology of Kashmira is that it is land desiccated 
            from water. Geologists agree that the Valley was formerly a lake, and the lake 
            drained through the gap of Baramulla (Varahamula) which matches with the Hindu 
            legends. The Kashmir region lies between latitudes 32° and 36° N, and longitudes
            74° and 80° E. It has an area of 68,000 sq mi (180,000 km2). It is bordered to 
            the north and east by China (Xinjiang and Tibet), to the northwest by 
            Afghanistan (Wakhan Corridor), to the west by Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
            and Punjab) and to the south by India (Himachal Pradesh and Punjab). 
            The topography of Kashmir is mostly mountainous. It is traversed mainly 
            by the Western Himalayas. The Himalayas terminate in the western boundary of 
            Kashmir at Nanga Parbat. Kashmir is traversed by three rivers namely Indus, 
            Jehlum and Chenab. These river basins divide the region into three valleys 
            separated by high mountain ranges. The Indus valley forms the north and 
            north-eastern portion of the region which include bare and desolate 
            areas of Baltistan and Ladakh.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Indus River system forms the drainage basin of the Kashmir 
                region. The river enters the region in Ladakh at its southeastern 
                corner from the Tibetan Plateau, and flows northwest to run a 
                course through the entire Ladakh and Gilgit-Baltistan. Almost 
                all the rivers originating in these region are part of the Indus 
                river system. After reaching the end of the Greaty Himalayan range, 
                the Indus turns a corner and flows southwest into the Punjab plains. 
                The Jhelum and Chenab rivers also follow a course roughly parallel 
                to this, and join the Indus river in southern Punjab plains in Pakistan.</p>
