        <h2>SHILLONG</h2>
        <p>SHILLONG  is a hill station in the northeastern part of India and the capital of Meghalaya, 
        which means "The Abode of Clouds". It is the headquarters of the East Khasi Hills district. Shillong 
        is the 330th most populous city in India with a population of 143,229 according to the 2011 census. 
        It is said that the rolling hills around the town reminded the British of Scotland. Hence, they 
        would also refer to it as the "Scotland of the East". Shillong is at WikiMiniAtlas 25.57°N 91.88°E. 
        It lies on the Shillong Plateau, the only major uplifted structure in the northern Indian shield. 
        The city lies in the centre of the plateau and is surrounded by hills, three of which are revered 
        in Khasi tradition: Lum Sohpetbneng, Lum Diengiei, and Lum Shyllong.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Shillong has steadily grown in size since it was made the civil station of the Khasi and 
            Jaintia Hills in 1864 by the British. In 1874, on the formation of Assam as the Chief 
            Commissioner's Province, it was chosen as the headquarters of the new administration because 
            of its convenient location between the Brahmaputra and Surma valleys and more so because the 
            climate of Shillong was much cooler than tropical India. Shillong remained the capital of 
            undivided Assam until the creation of the new state of Meghalaya on 21 January 1972, 
            when Shillong became the capital of Meghalaya, and Assam moved its capital to Dispur in 
            Guwahati.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Shillong is just 100 km (62 mi) from Guwahati, which can be accessed by road along 
                NH 40, a journey of about 2 hours 30 minutes through lush green hills and the Umiam 
                lake in between.</p>

            <h2 id="text2">ELEPHANT FALLS</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec2" id="sec2">
            <p>Elephant Falls is a sight to behold and can be visited with family on a picnic or with 
            friends for a weekend outing. The waterfall got its name from a rock at its bottom that 
            appears like an elephant. Three separate cascades from these wonderful waterfalls enveloped 
            in lush greenery that the surrounding area features. While the soothing sound of the 
            crystal clear water brushing through the rocks calms your senses, the spectacular site 
            of the falls is a treat to your eyes. If you are on a quest to unravel the best of the 
            natural wonders in the region, Elephant Falls is easily among the best places to 
            visit in Shillong.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The original Khasi name for the falls is Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew, which 
                translates to "the three - step waterfall". This name is still used locally. 
                However the modern name is explained by a signboard near the waterfall. The 
                name originated in the British era when the Englishmen spotted a giant rock
                that looked like an elephant near the fall. This rock was destroyed in the 
                1897 due to an earthquake. The sides of the waterfall are flanked by lush 
                greenery and are rich in ferns. A small signboard quite near the Shillong 
                Peak, marks a small road that turns off to the edge of the mountain. This 
                road leads to the falls. From the gate, there is a steep, slippery flight 
                of stairs to navigate each level of the fall with the first and second level 
                facilitated with benches to rest and relax.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>ELEPHANT FALLS is located in Upper Shillong, Shillong. Elephant Falls is 12 KM away 
                    from Shillong Bus Stand. Timings are from 10 AM to 6 PM. Entry Fees is INR 20 per
                    person.</p>

            <h2 id="text3">LAITLUM CANYONS</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec3" id="sec3">
                <p>Just a 45-minute drive away from the city of Shillong, Laitlum Canyons is one of the 
                priceless gems bestowed upon the region by nature. Laitlum literally means ‘The End of Hills’ 
                and the panoramic vistas you can enjoy from here justify the name given to it. One of the 
                lesser-known tourist places in Shillong, Laitlum Canyons is a perfect getaway spot if 
                it is solace and solitude you seek since it is away from the blaring cacophony of the 
                urban spaces. Perched atop serene hills of East Khasi, making this place quite 
                popular among photographers and trekkers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Laitlum Canyon is open for visits throughout the year. But if you are not a 
                    seasoned trekker, it’s advisable to not undertake the hike during the monsoon season 
                    as the heavy rainfall makes for a perilous climb. You must take extra care to look out
                    for the slippery steps at the summit. However, you should make sure that you reach 
                    the summit or the adjoining village well before 5 PM since it is dangerous to be out 
                    on the trails after that time. The last motorable point before the canyons is about 
                    23 km away from the city of Shillong. The route goes through the MDR32, NH44, Jongsha 
                    Mawkinrew Road and Unmed Road till its end. The end of Unmed Road is the last motorable point. From here, one has to hike for about two hours to reach the summit.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>LAITLUM CANYONS is located in East Khasi Hills, Shillong. Distance from Shillong 
                        Bus Stand is 23 KM.</p>

            <h2 id="text4">UMIAM LAKE </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec4" id="sec4">
                    <p>One of the most iconic sites in the entirety of Meghalaya, Umiam Lake is a perfect spot 
                    for leisure and rejuvenation. It is a reservoir that was built on Umiam River in the 1960s 
                    and has been a treat to visitors’ senses ever since. In addition to the lake being a popular 
                    picnic spot among locals and tourists visiting Shillong, the scenic beauty of the vast lake 
                    with azure waters is truly enchanting and makes it an ideal spot for landscape photographers. 
                    As Umiam Lake is one of the best tourist places in Shillong for adventure, you can even 
                    indulge in thrilling water activities like kayaking, boating, and cruising here.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Umiam Dam, which impounds the lake, was built by the Assam State Electricity Board in the
                        early 1960s. The dam's original purpose was to store water for hydroelectric power generation. 
                        The Umiam Stage I powerhouse, north of the lake, has four 9-MW turbine-generators, which entered 
                        commercial operation in 1965. Umiam Stage I was the first reservoir-storage hydroelectric 
                        project commissioned in the northeastern region of India. (Umtru Hydroelectric Project, a 
                        run-of-river project with an original capacity of 8.4 MW, began operation in 1957.) Three 
                        more stages of the Umiam Project were subsequently built downstream. Apart from storing 
                        water for electricity generation, the lake also provides numerous ecosystem services at 
                        micro, meso and macro levels. Downstream irrigation, fisheries, and drinking water 
                        cater to local anthropogenic needs.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>UMIAM LAKE is 15 KM north of Shillong. Distance from Shillong Bus Stand is 17 KM. Timings of
                            water sports arre available from 9 AM to 5 PM. Entry fees is INR 20 per person. Meghalaya is 
                            blessed with so many unique places that you can easily spend a month exploring this
