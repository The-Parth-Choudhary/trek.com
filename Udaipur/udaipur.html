        <h2>UDAIPUR</h2>
        <p>UDAIPUR is a city in the state of Rajasthan, India. It is the historic capital of the kingdom 
        of Mewar in the former Rajputana Agency. It was founded in 1559 by Udai Singh II of the Sisodia 
        clan of Rajput, when he shifted his capital from the city of Chittorgarh to Udaipur after Chittorgarh 
        was besieged by Akbar. It remained as the capital city till 1818 when it became a British princely 
        state, and thereafter the Mewar province became a part of Rajasthan when India gained independence 
        in 1947. The Girwa region was thus already well known to Chittaud rulers who moved to it whenever 
        the vulnerable tableland Chittaurgarh was threatened with enemy attacks. Rana Udai Singh II, in the 
        wake of 16th-century emergence of artillery warfare, decided during his exile at Kumbhalgarh to move 
        his capital to a more secure location.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The city is located in the southernmost part of Rajasthan, near the Gujarat border. It is 
            surrounded by the Aravali Range, which separates it from the Thar Desert. It is around 660 km 
            from Delhi and approximately 800 km from Mumbai, placed almost in the middle of two major Indian
            metro cities. Besides, connectivity with Gujarat ports provide Udaipur a strategic geographical 
            advantage. Udaipur is well connected with nearby cities and states by means of road, rail and 
            air transportation facilities. The city is served by the Maharana Pratap Airport. Common languages 
            spoken include Hindi, English and Rajasthani (Mewari). Udaipur is rising as educational hub as well, 
            with 5 Universities, 14 colleges and more than 160 high schools. Udaipur is home to IIM Udaipur, 
            the fifth best management institution in the country according to NIRF ranking released by the MHRD.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Udaipur is located at 24.525049°N 73.677116°E. The city covers an area of 64 km SQ. (25 sq mi) 
                and lies at an altitude of 598.00 m (1,962 ft) above sea level. It is located in the southern region 
                of Rajasthan, near the Gujarat border. The city lies 403 km (250 mi) southwest of the state capital,

            This magnificent structure was built on the Lake Pichola by Maharana Jagat Singh in 1734. Once a 
            summer palace for the royalty of Udaipur, it has now been converted into a heritage hotel. Still 
            retaining the grandeur, it resembles a fairy tale kingdom. Enhancing the magical aura are the 
            rippling waves and the beautiful sunset. The intricate craftsmanship and aesthetic handicrafts 
            and textiles add to the beauty this place. The elegant white marble palace is a fantasy as it 
            arises softly from the blue waters. 4 acres of rock have been used to lay the foundation of this 
            palace and was known as Jag Niwas after its founder. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The palace highlights include fountains, gardens, pillared terraces, painted mirrors,

                <p>The City Palace in Udaipur in the state of Rajasthan has a lot in its store to reveal the 
                age-old history it possesses. The royal building is a huge complex with plenty of rooms and 
                pillars inside. It took more than 300 years to complete the structure properly. Started during 
                the time of Maharana Udai Singh II. The lake Pichola nearby is the highlight when you get ready 
                for a tour of the greatest places to visit in Udaipur. Since it is the biggest building in Udaipur 
                it is considered as one of the best sightseeing destinations.  The flamboyant structure with a blend 
                of Mughal and Rajasthani architectural style dominates other famous palaces and buildings around 
                the city very authentically.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But with the increasing Marathas attacks by 1761, Udaipur and the Mewar state were in dire straits 
                    and in ruins. By 1818, Maharana Bhim Singh signed a treaty with the British accepting their protection 
                    against the other empires. After the Indian independence in 1947, the Mewar Kingdom, along with other 
                    princely states of Rajasthan, merged with the democratic India, in 1949. The Mewar Kings subsequently 
                    also lost their special royal privileges and titles. The successive Maharanas, however, retained their 
                    ownership of the palaces in Udaipur and converted parts of the palace complex into heritage hotels. The 
                    palace of Udaipur, which is a glorious symbol of Mewar, in front of thousands of Sadhu - Sadvis, 
                    Shravak-Sravikas, Pujya Shri Ganeshacharya the then head of Shri Akhil Bharat Varshiya Sadhumargi

        <div class="sec4" id="sec4">
                    <p>The vintage car museum in Udaipur was unveiled for the general public on 15th February 2000 
                    and is one of the places to visit in Udaipur. This inauguration has allowed the local and foreign 
                    visitors to appreciate the collection of cars of the Maharanas of Mewar. The vehicles in the museum 
                    are more than 70 years old but each have been beautifully restored and live in to tell the story.
                    The vintage car collection is placed in the Mewar State Motor Garage. This place is also home to a 
                    famous garden restaurant, The Bougainvillea. This motor garage is semi-circular in shape and with its
                    forecourt is housed inside a bigger courtyard. There is an old Shell petrol pump inside the garage 
                    which is still in working condition. This garage was built during a time when only the Maharanas of 
                    Mewar had owned the cars.</p>
                        <br>

                        being over seventy years old, each one is still kept in working condition.</p>

                <h2 id="text5">LAKE PICHOLA </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="sec5" id="sec5">
            <p>This is one of the most important places to visit in Udaipur. Lake Pichola is the reason 
            we call Udaipur the ‘City of Lakes’. Built in 1362, and extending 3 miles in length and 2 miles 
            in breadth, this lake is an essential part of Udaipur and far by its best feature. Astonished 
            and amazed by the beauty of Lake Pichola, Rudyard Kipling once wrote: "If the Venetian owned 
            the Pichola Lake, he might say with justice, `see it and die'". The iconic sites around the 
            lake include Udaipur City Palace, Mohan Mandir, Eklinggarh Fort, Jag Mandir, Pichola Palace 
            etc. The Sitamata Game Sanctuary is located on its western shore.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Take Kipling at his word and visit Lake Pichola when in Udaipur, both in the day and at 
                night. the lake takes on a whole new character depending on the time of the day. In the 
                morning, lake and palaces are quiet. The lake is speckled with tourist boats and people 
                clicking selfies line the shores. As night creeps in, all the Palaces around the lake light 
                up and illuminate the lake. No boats, no birds, nothing to see except the lit-up palaces as 
                they stand impressively around the lake. It is an awe-imposing spectacle.</p>
                <br>
                <p>LAKE PICHOLA is 5KM away from the city. It is located in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Udaipur, 
                in turn, is well connected through the Golden Quadrilateral road network, and it lies equidistant, 
                at 650 kilometres, from Delhi and Mumbai on the National Highway (NH) 8. Jaipur, the capital of 
                Rajasthan is 6 hours by road and 3.5 hours drive from Ahmedabad to Udaipur. Rajasthan Tourism 
                operates regular bus service from Delhi. It also falls on the East West Corridor which starts 
                from Porbandar and ends at Silchar and intersects the Golden Quadrilateral and a part of this 
                is the stretch from Udaipur to Chittor. 24 km from the lake is the Dabok Airport which connects 
                to Delhi and Bombay. Udaipur Railway Station and Maharana Pratap Bus Stand are both 3 km away 
                from the Lake.</p>
