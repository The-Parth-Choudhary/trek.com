        <h2>LAHAUL-SPITI</h2>
        <p>The Lahaul and Spiti district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh consists of the two 
        formerly separate districts of Lahaul tibetan Garzha and Spiti. The present administrative 
        centre is Kyelang in Lahaul. Before the two districts were merged, Kardang was the capital 
        of Lahaul, and Dhankar the capital of Spiti. The district was formed in 1960, and is the fourth 
        least populous district in India (out of 640). It is the least densely populated district of 
        India, according to the Census of India 2011. Most of the Lahaulis follow a combination of 
        Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism of the Drukpa Kagyu order, while the Spiti Bhotia follow 
        Tibetan Buddhism of the Gelugpa order. Within Lahoul, the Todh-Gahr (upper region of Lahaul 
        towards Ladakh) region had the strongest Buddhist influence, owing to its close proximity to Spiti.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kunzum la or the Kunzum Pass (altitude 4,551 m (14,931 ft)) is the entrance pass to the 
            Spiti Valley from Lahaul. It is 21 km (13 mi) from Chandra Tal. This district is connected 
            to Manali through the Rohtang Pass. To the south, Spiti ends 24 km (15 mi) from Tabo, at 
            the Sumdo where the road enters Kinnaur and joins with National Highway No. 5.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Spiti is barren and difficult to cross, with an average elevation of the valley floor 
            of 4,270 m (14,010 ft). It is enclosed between lofty ranges, with the Spiti river rushing 
            out of a gorge in the southeast to meet the Sutlej River. It is a typical mountain desert 
            area with an average annual rainfall of only 170 mm (6.7 in). The district has close cultural 
            links with Ngari Prefecture of Tibet Autonomous Region.</p>

            <h2 id="text2">CHANDRATAL LAKE</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec2" id="sec2">
            <p>Perched at a staggering altitude of 4200 meters above sea level, you have to witness the 
            unparalleled beauty of Chandratal to believe it. A sanctuary from the lightning fast city life, 
            this lake is slowly becoming one of the most attractive tourist places in Spiti valley. With 
            the spellbinding backdrop of majestic mountains and meadows covered with gorgeous wildflowers, 
            the lake is the perfect place to click Instagram worthy pictures. On your way, you will also get 
            to climb the glaciers between Kunzum pass and Rohtang Pass. This mesmerizing site has much folklore 
            attached to itself but what lures its visitors is its turquoise blue water, majestic mountains 
            and serene surroundings which make it an apt place for camping. Sprawled over an area of 2.5 kilometers, 
            Chandratal sees a massive influx of travelers during the summer months.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Winter is not considered as an ideal time to plan your Chandratal Lake visit as the entire 
                way is blocked with snow. The snow starts clearing up in the May month, but the routes beyond 
                Losar will still be blocked. The best time to visit Chandratal Lake is in June month when the 
                snow clearance operation is complete. During this time, you can reach the lake by trekking the 
                14 km long road from Batal. You can also plan your visit between July to September as the roads 
                remain open and the weather turned pleasant. But one should definitely avoid monsoon of August 
                due to wet roads and landslides.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The weather at Chandratal lake remains cold throughout the year. In the winter season, 
                    the average temperature varies from -40 to 0 degrees celsius. Though the summer months in Chandratal 
                    also remain cold, you will be able to relish snowfall mostly in winter months only.The average day and 
                    night temperature during the summer months range from 6 to 15-degree celsius. It is best to avoid the 
                    Chandratal trip during the monsoon as the site remains closed due to landslides.</p>

                    <p>The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback produced by Tesla, Inc. It was
                        introduced on June 22, 2012. It received a major refresh in June 2021. Tesla positions
                        the Model S as its flagship
                    In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in
                        any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013 and in Denmark in
                        December 2015. Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018. The Model S was the 
                        top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed
                        by the Model 3.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The best time to visit Kunzum Pass is from the second week of June to September except August
                        as the pass remains closed during monsoons and winters. During the months of winter, from 15th of 
                        October to April, the Kunzum Pass remains momentarily closed due to heavy snowfall. Although it is 
                        open in the monsoon month of August one should not plan their visit due to slippery routes and 
                        expected landslides.</p>

                    for being a habitat to the various endangered animals species like the snow leopard and the 
                    Siberian Ibex. Despite of the sparse vegetation, the park is known as a source for various 
                    sorts of medicinal herbs and various endangered plant species. The park marks the border 
                    between the formerly separate districts of Lahaul and Spiti. The elevation of the park ranges 
                    from about 3,500 metres (11,500 ft) near Ka Dogri to more than 6,000 metres (20,000 ft) at its

                    natural habitat for a number of endangered animals including the Snow Leopards[3] and Siberian ibex.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Because of the park's high altitude and extreme temperatures, the vegetation density is sparse, 
                        consisting mostly of alpine trees and groves of Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara). In summer, birds 
                        such as the Himalayan snowcock, chukar partridge, snow partridge, finches and choughs flourish in 
                        the park. Some plants within the park's alpine habitats have significant medicinal properties. 
                        Twenty-two rare and endangered medicinal plant species, have been discovered in and around Pin 
                        Valley National Park, which are distributed over 10 different habitat types. Aconitum rotundifolium, 
                        Arnebia euchroma, Ephedra gerardiana, Ferula jaeschkeana, Hyoscymus niger are the threatened but 
                        medicinally important plants occur in this national park.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Steeped in historical and present day Buddhist Tibetan culture, the area has many Tibetan 
                            Buddhist influences, evident architecturally in monasteries and stupas, and in the daily living 
                            of its residents and lamas. Pin Valley National Park, with an area of 675 square kilometres 
                            (261 sq mi) was established by India in 1958.</p>
