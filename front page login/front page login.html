        <h2>TRAVEL </h2>
        <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, 
        bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and 
        can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, 
        as in the case of tourism. The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" 
        may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.</p>
            <br>
            <p>According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. 
            It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen and earlier from Old French travailler
            In English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester 
            in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: 
            a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium. This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in 
            ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination. Travel 
            to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. 
            Travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by
            bullock cart</p>
            <br>
        <p>Reasons for traveling include recreation, holidays, tourism or vacationing, research travel, 
        the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel for charity, migration to begin 
        life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business travel, trade, 
        commuting, and other reasons, such as to obtain health care or waging or fleeing war or for 
        the enjoyment of traveling. Travelers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; 
        or vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains, ferries, boats, cruise ships and 
        airplanes.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Motives and benefits for travel include: pleasure, relaxation, discovery and exploration, 
            taking personal time for family and friends, avoiding stress and forming graceful memories. 
            Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety. When 
            traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be 
            subject to difficulties, crime and violence. Some safety considerations include being aware 
            of one's surroundings, avoiding being the target of a crime, leaving copies of one's passport 
            and itinerary information with trusted people, obtaining medical insurance valid in the 
            country being visited and registering with one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign 
            country. Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most 
            countries accept international driving permits. Automobile insurance policies issued in 
            one's own country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to 
            obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited. It is also advisable 
            to become oriented with the driving rules and -regulations of destination countries. Wearing 
            a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating 
            seatbelt laws.

        <p>Trekking is more challenging than hiking since it tests one's ability, endurance and their 
        mental as well as psychological capacity. There are many different ways to do a trek and trekking 
        culture often varies from country to country. It usually takes place on trails in areas of relatively 
        unspoiled wilderness. In Nepal, trekking is very popular among national and international tourist 
        due to the privilege of being in the home of Himalayas. Most of the famous trekking areas make an 
        amazing experience of the Himalaya.Most of the people they want to trek in the Mountain side of 
        the area here you will see the most of the trekking area and more detail of the Nepal trekking 
        for foreign and local tourist rekking can be viewed from two different points: as an intense 
        exercise, or an amazing and unique learning experience. Personally, I would love to learn 
        whatever, I can during my trek. In trekking, we have to face different difficulties and 
        uncertainties, by overcome them we allow ourselves to enhance our knowledge, experience 
        and the understanding of the world.</p>
            <br>

        undertaken with the specific purpose of exploring and enjoying the scenery. Trekking could 
        be a motive, It could be a commitment, an aim, an objective, a mission, a party, a social 
        gathering. It could be a place where you find friends, and it could be a journey. It could 
        be a slightest chance to save our future generation from losing the nature lovers, mother 
        earth holding within. It can be shortened or extended as per the desire of trekkers. Guide
         and potter hire as per daily basis. In this type of trekking there you the customer will
        be a pay service charge and wages of guide and potter as per daily basis or full trip basis

        basically involves the view of colorful horizons or sight of beautiful nature. Moderate Trekking: 
        Moderate trekking is more challenging than easy trekking. It is performed on medium to slightly
