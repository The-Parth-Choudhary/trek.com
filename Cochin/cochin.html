                <h2 id="text5">MARINE DRIVE</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="sec5" id="sec5">
            <p>Marine drive is a quaint destination amongst the many Cochin tourist places the Kerala 
            takes pride in. Exclusively built facing the backwaters, it offers a charming and a 
            picturesque image especially during the evening hours attracting the locals and tourists alike.
            Along with the Rainbow bridge, which is a major draw for tourists, the Marine drive is lined 
            with Shopping malls, fast food joints and other important landmark buildings of Kochi. Be ready 
            to be allured by the gentle breeze while enjoying a walk down the promenade enjoying the company 
            of your loved ones.</p>
            <br>
                <p>The view of the setting and rising sun over the sea mouth, and the gentle breeze from the
                Vembanad Lake has made Marine Drive an important tourist destination in Kochi. Hundreds of 
                people (both natives, and tourists) throng the walkway during the evenings. The walkway starts 
                from the High Court Junction and continues until the Rajendra Maidan. There are also several boat 
                jetties along the walkway. The walkway has three bridges: the Rainbow bridge, the Chinese Fishing 
                Net Bridge and the House Boat Bridge.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Until the 1980s, the Shanmugham Road was the literal marine drive with the Kochi Lake and the 
                adjoining Arabian Sea to its west. In the 1980s, GCDA started the Kochi Marine Drive project (following 
                from the Bombay Marine Drive) and thus the whole of the present Marine Drive (part of the Kochi Lake, 
                west of the Shanmugham Road to the present Marine Walkway) was claimed from the Kochi Lake. The 
                then plan of GCDA was to eventually construct a road on the western border of this land, which 
                would thus become a literal marine drive. But due to the enforcement of the Coastal Protection 
                Laws in India in the 1990s, construction of a road became impossible. That's what led the GCDA 
                toward settling down with a marine walkway instead of an actual marine drive. In 1992, under the
                leadership of the GCDA Chairman V. Joseph Thomas IPS a beautification project of the walkway was 
                established, leading to the construction of the iconic Rainbow Bridge. But the name Marine Drive, 
                since the initiation of the project in the 1980s, identifies the whole region (which was claimed 
                from the lake), and not just the walkway.</p>
