                <p>History of Chadwick Falls, Shimla</p>
                <br>
                <p>There is an interesting story attached to the name of Chadwick Falls. It was derived from
                two words ‘Chidku Jhaar’, where local considered Chidku as sparrow and Jhaar as jharna. They 
                named it so because they thought that only sparrows can touch the top of the waterfall and not 
                human beings. However, it was quite difficult for Britishers to pronounce it properly and hence
                they renamed it as Chadwick. Some also say that a renowned scientist named Chadwick committed 
                suicide from this location and that’s the major reason why it is called Chadwick. No matter how 
                it got its name, this attraction redefines the beauty in its own way and is a great place for 
                people who are looking to breathe in the fresh air.</p>
