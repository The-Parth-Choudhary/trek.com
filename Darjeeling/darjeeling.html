        <h2>DARJEELING</h2>
        <p>DARJEELING is a city and a municipality in the Indian state of West Bengal. It lies in the 
        Lesser Himalayas at an elevation of 2,000 metres (6,560 ft). It is noted for its tea industry, 
        its scenic views of the world's third-highest mountain Kangchenjunga, and the Darjeeling Himalayan 
        Railway, a narrow-gauge mountain railway which is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Darjeeling 
        is the headquarters of the Darjeeling district which has a partially autonomous status called 
        Gorkhaland Territorial Administration within the state of West Bengal. It is also a popular 
        tourist destination in India. The soil is chiefly composed of sandstone and conglomerate 
        formations, which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range of 
        Himalaya.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the early 19th century during East India Company rule in India a sanatorium and a 
            military depot were set up in the region. Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were 
            established, the tea growers developing hybrids of black tea and creating new fermentation 
            techniques. A distinctive Darjeeling tea emerged, which became internationally recognised 
            and has ranked among the most popular black teas in the world. The Darjeeling Himalayan 
            Railway connecting the town with the North Bengal plains was completed in 1881 and has 
            some of the few remaining steam locomotives in service in India. However, the soil is 
            often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water 
            between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep 
            slopes and loose topsoil, leading to frequent landslides during the monsoons.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Darjeeling has a temperate climate with wet summers caused by monsoon rains.
                According to India Meteorological Department, Darjeeling's annual mean maximum 
                temperature is 17.2 °C (63.0 °F) while the mean minimum temperature is 8.5 °C 
                (47.3 °F).[40] The lowest temperature ever recorded was −7.2 °C (19.0 °F) on 
                30 January 1971 while the highest temperature rose to 28.5 °C (83.3 °F) on 21 
                August 1970. The average annual precipitation is 2,380 mm (94 in), with an 
                average of 105 days of rain in a year.</p>

            <h1 id="text2"> HIMALAYAN RAILWAY </h1>
        </div>
        <div class="sec2" id="sec2">
            <p>One of the most popular places to visit in Darjeeling, DHR is approximately a 2 feet narrow 
            gauge train track that covers the distance between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. This 88-km 
            long railway track is best known for its toy train which gushes amid the misty hill side and 
            offers absolutely gorgeous views of the valley. The construction of this historic railways 
            began in 1879 and took about two years for it to be finished. For its significance as a popular 
            tourist spot, it was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. The ride in the toy train
            of Himalayan Railways Station is both adventurous as well relaxing in nature. If there is one thing 
            that you shouldn’t miss during your time in Darjeeling, it’s a ride in the toy train. No wonder it 
            tops the list of the best tourist attractions in Darjeeling.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The line follows Hill Cart Road, which is part of National Highway 110. The track is on the 
                roadside for long stretches, and both track and road might be blocked by a rockslide. Since a 
                length of the road is flanked with buildings, the railway line often resembles urban tramway 
                tracks. To warn pedestrians and drivers of an approaching train, engines are equipped with very 
                loud horns and whistles which train drivers sound almost constantly. A major difficulty faced by 
                the DHR was the steepness of the terrain. Loops and zig-zags were incorporated along the route 
                to achieve a comfortable gradient. When the train moves forward, reverses and then moves forward 
                again (climbing a slope while doing so), it gains altitude along the side of the hill.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>DARJEELING HIMALAYAN RAILWAY is loacted in New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. Entry Fees 
                    are INR 600 for diesel engine ride and INR 1000 for steam engine ride. Timings are form
                    8 AM to 12 PM.</p>

            <h2 id="text3">HAPPY VALLEY TEA ESTATE</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec3" id="sec3">
                <p>An area sprawling 437 acres, Happy Valley Tea Estate is one of the major places to see in 
                Darjeeling.  The place is home to one of the highest tea factories in the world. The tea factory
                of this estate was established in 1854 by an Englishman and after all these years, it continues to
                flourish under the care of Indian aristocracy from Hooghly. Your visit to Darjeeling won’t be 
                considered complete until you pay a visit to this aromatic tea estate. The minute you enter 
                the estate, the pure fragrance of well-manicured tea leaves will stir your mind with all the 
                good feelings. This alone makes a visit to the tea plantations of this area completely 
                worth it.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>If that’s not enough, the splendorous views of the majestic Kanchenjunga peak will leave 
                    you breathless and wanting for a day or two stay in the area. It is the second oldest tea 
                    estate of Darjeeling (after Steinthal Tea Estate, which was established in 1852), and, at a 
                    height of 2,100 metres (6,900 ft), is also one of the highest tea factories in the world. 
                    David Wilson, an Englishman, had named the garden Wilson Tea Estate and by 1860 had started 
                    cultivation of tea. In 1903, the estate was taken over by an Indian, Tarapada Banerjee, 
                    an aristocrat from Hooghly. In 1929, Banerjee bought the Windsor Tea Estate nearby, and 
                    merged the two estates under the name of Happy Valley Tea Estate.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>HAPPY VALLEY TEA ESTATE is loacted in Lebong Cart Road, Chauk Bazaar, Near, Darjeeling,

            <h2 id="text4">TIGER HILL</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sec4" id="sec4">
                    <p>The most famous mountain peak in Darjeeling, Tiger Hill is best known for its trekking 
                    routes and panoramic views of Mt. Everest and Kanchenzonga. One needs to walk or drive 
                    through the oldest tea plantations, in order to reach Tiger Hill. It is recommended to 
                    witness the first rays of the sun on Mt. Everest. Don’t miss capturing it in your camera 
                    as well because it will be a majestically rich experience. Another interesting thing about 
                    this place is that it is the summit of Ghoom, a UNESCO World Heritage Site as well as the 
                    highest railway station in Darjeeling. The best time to visit Tiger Hill is generally 
                    around the months of October, November and December in winter and February to April in 
                    Autumn.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It is 11 km from the town of Darjeeling and can be reached either by jeep or by foot 
                        through Chowrasta, Alubari or Jorebangla and then climbing up the incline to the summit.
                        At sunrise, the peaks of Kanchenjunga are illuminated before the sun is seen at lower 
                        elevations. From Tiger Hill, Mount Everest (8848 m) is just visible. Kanchenjunga (8598 m) 
                        looks higher than Mt. Everest, as it is several miles closer than Everest. The distance in 
                        a straight line from Tiger Hill to Everest is 107 miles (172 km). On a clear day, Kurseong 
                        is visible to the south and in the distance, along with Teesta River, Mahananda River, Balason 
                        River and Mechi River meandering down to the south. Chumal Rhi mountain of Tibet, 84 miles 
                        (135 km) away, is visible over the Chola range.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="sec5" id="sec5">
            <p>It is a mesmerizing toy train pathway that was brought into existence to reduce the elevation
            of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. Set amidst the lush green mountainside, Batasia Loop 
            offers beautiful views of the valley and snowy abode of Mt. Kanchendzonga. When the toy train 
            meanders its way through the loops of the track, everything about this place seems dreamy. 
            Also, the surrounding tunnels, hill-locked valley and little shops in the area makes Batasia 
            Loop one of the top places to visit in Darjeeling. It is 5 km (3 mi) from Darjeeling, below 
            Ghum. There is also a memorial to the Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army who sacrificed 
            their lives after the Indian Independence in 1947.</p>

                <p>It is recommended to visit the Loop after witnessing the sunrise at Tiger Hill. 
                This is because the carpet of flowers that leads to Batasia Loop is quite splendorous, 
                especially to the eyes that have witnessed the most beautiful sunrise ever. Additionally, 
                the spiral railway track is a sight to behold for dreamers and artists. The entire
